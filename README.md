# IntervalIntMap

An interval map that works only with `Int`s.

This is not a general purpose package, it serves mostly as support for
[NGLess](https://ngless.embl.de) and is used there.

Do get [in touch](mailto:luis@luispedro.org) if you want to use it more
generally, but the plans for this repo is to develop it only in so far as it
helps with NGLess' goals.
